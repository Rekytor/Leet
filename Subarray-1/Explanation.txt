Dear Diary
1-I completed this mission in like 5 or 6 hours (i'm crying) with old school tactics.
Since i forgot the usage of pointers which helps with only getting the addresses of values, it used a lot of runtime and a little more memory than necessary

2- I worked even more than 6 hours and still not finished because it does not pass the runtime constraint on leetcode. Appearently it can be solved with sliding window algorithm like before.
